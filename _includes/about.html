              <div class="about-body">
                saveDAI makes it super simple for your to earn interest on your savings while staying protected against many risks that could impact your savings.<br/><br/>
                All you have to do is deposit DAI (or dollars, via <a href="https://www.sendwyre.com">Wyre</a>) and saveDAI takes care of the rest.<br/><br/>
                Under the hood, saveDAI deposits your DAI into <a href="https://compound.finance">Compound</a> and receives back cDAI, then purchases insurance from <a href="https://www.opyn.co">Opyn Protocol</a> in the form of ocDAI. Your saveDAI tokens then represent the combination of cDAI and ocDAI &mdash; effectively a self-insured savings account.<br/><br/>
                saveDAI will also allow you to submit an insurance claim to receive back the original value of your deposit, or remove the insurance if you'd like.<br/><br/>
                Note that saveDAI cannot protect your savings against all risks, and there will always be risks in finance, especially systems that are new. Please take caution whenever managing your money.<br/>
